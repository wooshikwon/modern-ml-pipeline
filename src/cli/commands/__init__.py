"""CLI Commands Module

This module contains all CLI command implementations for Modern ML Pipeline.
Organized by functionality:
- init_command: Project initialization
- get_recipe_command: Interactive recipe generation
- system_check_command: Config-based system validation

All commands are now unified in the main commands.py file.

# Import nothing - commands are handled by main CLI entry points
