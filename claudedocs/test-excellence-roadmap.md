## 📋 Execution Methodology

### Real Object Testing Compliance
Following tests/README.md principles:

```python
# ✅ Correct Pattern - Real Objects with Context
def test_factory_component_creation(component_test_context):
    with component_test_context.classification_stack() as ctx:
        factory = Factory(ctx.settings)
        adapter = factory.create_data_adapter()  # Real object
        result = adapter.read(ctx.data_path)     # Real execution
        assert ctx.validate_data_flow(result)    # Context validation

# ❌ Avoid - Internal Mocking
def test_factory_component_creation():
    factory = Factory(mock_settings)
    with patch('src.components.StorageAdapter'):  # DON'T DO THIS
        adapter = factory.create_data_adapter()
```
